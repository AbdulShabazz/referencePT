# The Reference Path Tracer Code sample

This is a supplemental code accompanying Ray Tracing Gems II, Chapter 14: The Reference Path Tracer. Code is based on [IntroToDXR](https://github.com/acmarrs/IntroToDXR/) and implements a path tracer described in the article. The sample application loads GLTF scenes, specified via command line. The core of the path tracer can be found in single HLSL file - `PathTracer.hlsl`.

## Command Line Arguments

* `-width [integer]` specifies the width (in pixels) of the rendering window
* `-height [integer]` specifies the height (in pixels) of the rendering window
* `-vsync [0|1]` specifies whether vsync is enabled or disabled
* `-scene [path]` specifies the file path to a GLTF model
* `-scenePath [path]` optionally specifies the root folder where scene data files can be found

Note: EXE File must be called from root project folder (or use run.bat!), because the renderer assumes a known folder structure
